My <a href="https://github.com/arlange" target="_blank">github</a> contains two repositories for some of the work I've done on Ramsey problems. 'archer' contains software for generating, manipulating, and outputting graphs to test for the Folkman problem. The main software contains a command-prompt to do these things. The command 'help' prints all commands. It can generate the residue graphs such as $G(127,3)$, the circulant graphs Lu used (the 785 one that we showed arrowed $(3,3)$), circulant graphs based on distances, Hamming graphs, Turan graphs, graphs based on Galois Fields and projective planes, GCD circulant graphs, random graphs (the $K_4$-free process), and lots more. It can output graphs in almost any format you would want (graph6, graphviz, SAT, SDP, etc). 'glue' is what I use for gluing $(C_4,K_m)$-graphs. Both programs have similar underlying data structures based on bits. 'archer' calls the NTL library, 'glue' calls nauty. Both use terrible coding practices and have virtually no comments.
