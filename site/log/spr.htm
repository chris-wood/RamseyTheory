<p><h4>Interesting graphs</h4>
<ul>
<li>
We have 4 strange and unique in a few ways (K3,J11;32,80)-graphs
(<a href="k3j11n32e80.g6">g6</a>).
Try to draw one of them (or all), or give some compact description.</li>
<li>
Geoff Exoo just found a new lower bound for R(3,16) by presenting a
<a href="k3k16n81.mat">matrix of a (3,16;81)-graph</a>. Check its
correctness and look for a nice graph presentation.
<li>
We found 8 nonisomorphic 4-colorings
(<a href="b4n18.mc">mc-format</a>)
of K18,18 without monochromatic C4's, which establish
the lower bound for the bipartite Ramsey number b4(2)=19.
The construction of one of them
(<a href="b4n18.jpg">matrix.jpg</a>)
and related results are described in a paper
(<a href="http://www.cs.rit.edu/~spr/PUBL/zr13.pdf">pdf, pages 10-12</a>).
<li>
Generate all (3,3,3;n)-colorings for all n, count them by various
criteria (edges, automorphisms, weak/strong isomorphism, and others).
Partial enumerations are described at positions 39, 40 and 47 of my
<a href="http://www.cs.rit.edu/~spr/PUBL/publ.html">publication list</a>.
