<h3>Week 4</h3>
<p> 
	This week I worked on the following tasks:
	<ul>
		<li>
			Wrapped my graph reduction program <a href="caw_doc/reducer.txt">reducer.py</a> with another
			program <a href="caw_doc/injector.txt">injector.py</a> that can specify the number of vertices
			to remove, the format of removal (i.e. structured removal of independent sets or unstructured, random removal
			of vertices), the number of variables to assign to truth values in the corresponding CNF formula for
			the induced subgraph, and the propagation level (i.e. how many times to recursively propagate
			truth values through the clauses of $\phi_H$, where $H = G[V], V \subset V(G_{127})$) when assigning
			truth values. 
		</li>
		<li>
			I also ran experiments for structured removal of vertices as a preliminary estimate of the
			hardness of the satisfiability problem. You can view the results in the SAT report <a href="caw_doc/SATreport.pdf">here</a>.
			The CNF formulas generated for the subgraphs of $G$ with $n$ vertices removed are here: <a href="caw_doc/g127_43.cnf">43</a> (<a href="caw_doc/data/g127_43">output</a>), <a href="caw_doc/g127_44.cnf">44</a> (<a href="caw_doc/data/g127_44">output</a>), <a href="caw_doc/g127_45.cnf">45</a> (<a href="caw_doc/data/g127_45">output</a>), and <a href="caw_doc/g127_46.cnf">46</a> (<a href="caw_doc/data/g127_46">output</a>). 
		</li>
		<li>
			Continued working on the Folkman survey. As usual, you may view the working copy <a href="caw_doc/FolkmanSurvey.pdf">here</a>. Rather than posting the new papers that were read, you may view the bibliography contained therein.
		</li>
		<li>
			Tried to verify the (3,16;81) graph presented by Geoff Exoo with Mathematica. 
			You can view the resulting PDF <a href="caw_doc/g_3_16_81.pdf">here</a>. Finding the 
			maximum clique for the graph took a long time, so I had to terminate the process after a while.
		</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Week 3</h3>
<p>
	This week I worked on the following tasks:
	<ul>
		<li>$C_5$ permutation constructions - you can see all 12 permutations of $C_5$ <a href="caw_doc/c5permutations.mat">here</a>.</li>
		<li>Explored the four different $(K_3, J_{11};32,80)$ graphs proposed by Dr. Radziszowski. You can view the graphs in their pictoral form <a href="caw_doc/specialGraphs.pdf">here</a>. I am still working on trying to give a compact description of the first one.</li>
		<li>Continued looking at the $nauty$ bit-packing algorithm distributed by Dr. Radziszowski. I want to see if this can be applied to Alex's work with massive graphs to save space.</li>
		<li>Downloaded and installed the latest SAT solvers from the 2011 SAT competiton website shown <a href="http://www.satcompetition.org/">here</a>. I also began structuring the report that will compare the performance of these SAT solvers when trying to solve the $G_{127}$ conjecture. You can view the report <a href="caw_doc/SATreport.pdf">here</a>.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	I also continued progress with the Folkman survey, documenting the major results from the following paper:
	<ul>
		<li>Kolev, Nikolay. "Bounds on Some Edge Folkman Numbers." arXiv e-prints arXiv:1001.1905v2 (2011).</li>
	</ul>
	<del>I will post the most recent version of the survey paper on 3/27/13.</del> <br/>
	The most recent version of the Folkman survey paper is <a href="caw_doc/FolkmanSurvey.pdf">here</a>.

<h3>Week 2</h3>
<p>
	This week I worked on the following tasks:
	<ul>
		<li>
			Began experimenting with techniques to reduce the order of $G_{127}$ to smaller graphs that can be 
			reduced to 3-SAT formulas to check for satisfiability. Currently, induced subgraphs containing approximately
			$80$ vertices can be solved very easily, but pushing this bound up towards $127$ becomes much more difficult.
			In particular, I tried to remove three sets of independent sets in $V \subset V(G_{127})$ such that $|V(G)| = 11$.
			After reducing this to an equivalent 3-SAT formula and running with Minisat I found that such reduction was not
			sufficient to make the program finish in a reasonable amount of time.

			The 3-SAT formula used for the entire graph of $G_{127}$ is <a href="caw_doc/g127.cnf">here</a> and the reduction 
			of $G_{127}$ obtained by removing three independent sets is <a href="caw_doc/out_3.cnf">here</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Continued my more in-depth exploration of nauty, with a focus on automorphism group generation and the underlying
			canonical labeling algorithm, as explained in Brendan McKay's paper: McKay, Brendan D. "Practical graph isomorphism." (1981): 45-87.
			I also started experimenting with Brendan McKay's new graph compression algorithm that was provided by Dr. Radziszowski.
		</li>
		<li>
			Continued my literature survey on Folkman numbers. In particular, I read the following papers and collected their major
			results in my survey paper.
			<ul>
				<li>
					Nenov, Nedyalko Dimov. "Chromatic number of graphs and edge Folkman numbers." arXiv preprint arXiv:1002.4332 (2010).
				</li>
				<li>
					Kolev, Nikolay. "New Upper Bound for the Edge Folkman Number $F_e(3,5;13)$." arXiv e-prints arXiv:0806.1403 (2008).
				</li>
				<li>
					Nenov, Nedyalko Dimov. "On the triangle vertex Folkman numbers." Discrete mathematics 271.1 (2003): 327-334.

	You may also find my source code for the graph arrowing property <a href="caw_doc/folkman.cpp">here</a>, as well
	as the source code for generating a DIMACS-compliant 3-SAT CNF formula for the problem 
	$G \to (3,3)^e$ <a href="caw_doc/reduce.txt">here</a>.

<h3>Week 1</h3>

<p>
	This week we began with an overview of Folkman numbers given by Professor Radziszowski. I spent my time reading some of his papers on the subject, including:
	<ul>
		<li>Lathrop, Joel and Stanislaw Radziszowski. "Computing the Folkman Number F_v(2,2,2,2,2;4). Journal of Combinatorial Mathematics and Combinatorial Computing, 78 (2011) 119-128.</li>
		<li>Radziszowski, Stanislaw and Xu Xiaodong. "On the Most Wanted Folkman Graph." Geombinatorics, Vol. XVI (4) (2007) 367-381.</li>
		<li>Lange, Alexander, Stanislaw Radziszowski, and Xiaodong Xu. "Use of MAX-CUT for Ramsey Arrowing of Triangles." To appear in the Journal of Combinatorial Mathematics and Combinatorial Computing.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
I also began preparing an introductory presentation for nauty to be given in Week 2. The focus of the talk was to introduce people to the 
inner workings of nauty, its main purposes, and how we can apply it in our research. You can view the presentation 
<a href="caw_doc/nauty_intro.pdf">here</a>.
