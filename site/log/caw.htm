<h3>Week 2</h3>
<p>
	This week I worked on the following tasks:
	<ul>
		<li>
			Began experimenting with techniques to reduce the order of $G_{127}$ to smaller graphs that can be 
			reduced to 3-SAT formulas to check for satisfiability. Currently, induced subgraphs containing approximately
			$80$ vertices can be solved very easily, but pushing this bound up towards $127$ becomes much more difficult.
			In particular, I tried to remove three sets of independent sets in $V \subset V(G_{127})$ such that $|V(G)| = 11$.
			After reducing this to an equivalent 3-SAT formula and running with Minisat I found that such reduction was not
			sufficient to make the program finish in a reasonable amount of time.

			The 3-SAT formula used for the entire graph of $G_{127}$ is <a href="caw_doc/g127.cnf">here</a> and the reduction 
			of $G_{127}$ obtained by removing three independent sets is <a href="caw_doc/out_3.cnf">here</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Continued my more in-depth exploration of nauty, with a focus on automorphism group generation and the underlying
			canonical labeling algorithm, as explained in Brendan McKay's paper: McKay, Brendan D. "Practical graph isomorphism." (1981): 45-87.
			I also started experimenting with Brendan McKay's new graph compression algorithm that was provided by Dr. Radziszowski.
		</li>
		<li>
			Continued my literature survey on Folkman numbers. In particular, I read the following papers and collected their major
			results in my survey paper.
			<ul>
				<li>
					Nenov, Nedyalko Dimov. "Chromatic number of graphs and edge Folkman numbers." arXiv preprint arXiv:1002.4332 (2010).
				</li>
				<li>
					Kolev, Nikolay. "New Upper Bound for the Edge Folkman Number $F_e(3,5;13)$." arXiv e-prints arXiv:0806.1403 (2008).

		</li>
	</ul>

	You may also find my source code for the graph arrowing property <a href="caw_doc/folkman.cpp">here</a>, as well
	as the source code for generating a DIMACS-compliant 3-SAT CNF formula for the problem 
	$G \to (3,3)^e$ <a href="caw_doc/reduce.txt">here</a>.
