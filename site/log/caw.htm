<h3>Week 2</h3>
<p>
	This week I worked on the following tasks:
	<ul>
		<li>
			Began experimenting with techniques to reduce the order of $G_{127}$ to smaller graphs that can be 
			reduced to 3-SAT formulas to check for satisfiability. Currently, induced subgraphs containing approximately
			$80$ vertices can be solved very easily, but pushing this bound up towards $127$ becomes much more difficult.
			In particular, I tried to remove three sets of independent sets in $V \subset V(G_{127})$ such that $|V(G)| = 11$.
			After reducing this to an equivalent 3-SAT formula and running with Minisat I found that such reduction was not
			sufficient to make the program finish in a reasonable amount of time.

			The 3-SAT formula used for the entire graph of $G_{127}$ is <a href="caw_doc/g127.cnf">here</a> and the reduction 
			of $G_{127}$ obtained by removing three independent sets is <a href="caw_doc/out_3.cnf">here</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Continued my more in-depth exploration of nauty, with a focus on automorphism group generation and the underlying
			canonical labeling algorithm, as explained in Brendan McKay's paper: McKay, Brendan D. "Practical graph isomorphism." (1981): 45-87.
			I also started experimenting with Brendan McKay's new graph compression algorithm that was provided by Dr. Radziszowski.
		</li>
		<li>
			Continued my literature survey on Folkman numbers. In particular, I read the following papers and collected their major
			results in my survey paper.

					Nenov, Nedyalko Dimov. "Chromatic number of graphs and edge Folkman numbers." arXiv preprint arXiv:1002.4332 (2010).

<h3>Week 1</h3>

<p>
	This week we began with an overview of Folkman numbers given by Professor Radziszowski. I spent my time reading some of his papers on the subject, including:
	<ul>
		<li>Lathrop, Joel and Stanislaw Radziszowski. "Computing the Folkman Number F_v(2,2,2,2,2;4). Journal of Combinatorial Mathematics and Combinatorial Computing, 78 (2011) 119-128.</li>
		<li>Radziszowski, Stanislaw and Xu Xiaodong. "On the Most Wanted Folkman Graph." Geombinatorics, Vol. XVI (4) (2007) 367-381.</li>
		<li>Lange, Alexander, Stanislaw Radziszowski, and Xiaodong Xu. "Use of MAX-CUT for Ramsey Arrowing of Triangles." To appear in the Journal of Combinatorial Mathematics and Combinatorial Computing.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
I also began preparing an introductory presentation for nauty to be given in Week 2. The focus of the talk was to introduce people to the 
inner workings of nauty, its main purposes, and how we can apply it in our research. You can view the presentation 
<a href="caw_doc/nauty_intro.pdf">here</a>.
