\section{Introduction}
In his 1972 seminal paper entitled, ``Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems,'' Karp introduced a 
list of 21 NP-complete problems, including Boolean satisfiability, the maximum cut of a graph, 
and 0-1 integer programming \cite{karp72}. The complexity of these problems was proven by deriving
a polynomial-time reduction from CIRCUIT-SAT = $\{\langle C \rangle : C$ is a satisfiable Boolean combinational
circuit $\}$, the first problem shown to be NP-complete by Cook in 1971 \cite{cook71-np}, starting
the rush of complexity theory research. 

The problem $3-SAT$, or more formally, $3-CNF SAT$, is a special case of satisfiability.
It is a decision problem in which takes as input a 3-CNF Boolean formula and returns YES if 
the formula is satisfiable, and NO otherwise \cite{clrs90-algorithms}. A 3-CNF formula, more formally known as a Boolean 
formula in 3-conjunctive normal form, is expressed as the Boolean AND of arbitrarily many clauses,
where each clause is the Boolean OR of three literals, which is a Boolean variable or its negation. 
Such a Boolean formula is said to be satisfiable if and only if there exists an assignment of truth 
values to the variables such that substituting them into the literals of the formula will cause it 
to evaluate to true (or 1). Expressed as a formal language, we have that 
$3-SAT = \{\langle \phi \rangle : \phi \text{ is satisfiable }\}$.

In 2002 Hans van Maaren of and John Franco initiated the public SAT competition in
search of optimal performing SAT solvers judged by a variety of criteria and specializations, 
including their ability to demonstrate satisfiability and exhaustively prove unsatisfiability.
In addition, since $SAT$ is a problem that often arises in academia and the industry, 
each of the candidate solvers are rigorously tested with massive application-specific, 
crafted, and random Boolean formulas as input. With three different solver
specializations tested against three different types of inputs, and a first, second, 
and third place awarded to the candidates, a total of $27$ possible trophies are
awarded each year. In the most recent competition held in 2011, solvers were
tested using CPU time and world-clock time as a basis for their results, thus expanding
the trophy space to $54$ slots. The next competition is slated to take place in 2013. 

%TODO: sat problem, sat competition, categories of evaluation, types of problems, graph arrowing...
The $SAT$ problem is particularly interesting when applied to graph arrowing. It can be shown
how to reduce the question $G \overbrace{\to}^\text{?} \to (3,3)^e$ to an equivalent $3-CNF$ formula
$\phi_G$ such that $G \not \to (3,3)^e \Leftrightarrow \phi_G$. Intuitively, this is a very promising
technique for determining if $G \to (3,3)^e$ for $K_4$-free graphs $G$.

The immediate application of this technique is to attack the upper bound of the Folkman number
$F_e(3,3;4)$. In particular, to lower this bound, we will need to find a 
graph $G$ on $n$ vertices where $G \to (3,3)^e$. It has been conjectured that 
$G_{127} = G(127,3) = (\mathbb{Z}_{127}, E = \{(x,y) | x - y = \alpha^3 \mod 127\})$ is a
prime candidate for witnessing an upper bound of $127$ because of its denseness and large number
of triangles. To determine whether $G_{127}$ is indeed a witness we will decompose 
the problem of arrowing into problems on subgraphs $H$ that witness $H \not \to (3,3)^e$, 
and then carefully extend $H$ to encompass all of $G$. For each subgraph $H$ will generate
a corresponding $3$-$CNF$ formula $\phi_G$ by mapping the edges in $E(H)$ to variables 
in $\phi_H \in$ 3-SAT, and for edge adding the following clauses to $\phi_H$:
\begin{align*}
(x + y + z) \wedge (\bar{x} + \bar{y} + \bar{z})
\end{align*}
If $H$ can be extended to encompass all of $G$ and $\phi_G$ is 
shown to be unsatisfiable, then $G \to (3,3)^e$, and so $F_e(3,3;4) = 127$.

Unfortunately, while this approach seems simple upfront, the complexity of the formulas
$\phi_H$ with $n \approx 85$ has proven to be very difficult for modern SAT solvers
to handle. In this study, we will attempt to determine the structure of these formulas
that makes them so difficult to solve. We will also present a comprehensive performance 
comparison for the popular SAT solvers entered into the SAT competition, including
Minisat, zChaff, glucose, ppfolio //, ppfolio seq, contrasat hack, and 3S.

\section{$k-SAT$ Algorithms}
The algorithms used in state-of-the-art $SAT$ solvers tend to be based on the famous
DPLL backtracking algorithm proposed by David, Putnam, Logemann, and Loveland in \cite{DPLL}.
The DPLL algorithm works by recursively splitting a CNF formula into smaller formulas
by assigning truth values to individual variables and simplifying the resulting
formula at each level of iteration. Simplification works by removing all clauses in $\phi$ that
become true under the new assignment and all literals which are false. 
This process continues recursively until the formula is deemed satisfiable
or a conflict emerges. Satisfiability occurs when all variables have been assigned truth values 
and the resulting formula has non-empty clauses remaining, or when all clauses can be
evaluted to true. If a conflict arises, the algorithm backtracks to
the last assigned truth value, attempts to substitute the negated truth value, and then proceeds
as normal. A formula $\phi$ is deemed unsatisfiabile if this algorithm exhaustively
checks all possible truth value assignments without yielding a satisfiable formula. 

The DPLL algorithm further enhances the backtracking search through the use of two additional
procedures, unit propagation and pure literal elimination. Unit propagation works by assigning
an appropriate truth value to all unit clauses (i.e. all clauses with only a single literal) and
then propagating this truth value to the rest of the formula. For example, unit propagation
of the formula $\phi = [(x_1) \land (x_1 \lor x_2 \lor x_3)]$ yields $\phi = [(x_2 \lor x_3)]$ by
assigning a value of true to $x_1$. Pure literal elimination works by finding variables
with have uniform polarity (i.e. always positive or negative). For all such literals, there
always a exists a truth assignment such that the containing clauses will evaluate to true.
Therefore, such clauses are delete from $\phi$. For example, given the formula 
$\phi = [(x_1 \lor x_2 \lor \lnot x_3) \land (x_2 \lor \lnot x_3 \lor x_4) \land (x_1 \lor x_2 \lor \lnot x_4)]$,
performing pure literal elimination yields 
$\phi = [(x_1 \lor x_2 \lor \lnot x_4)]$ because we can assign $x_3 = false$ and eliminate
the first two clauses. These two procedures are shown in the pseudocode description shown
in Algorithm \ref{alg:DPLL}.

\EndFor
\State{$l \gets ChooseLiteral(\phi)$}\\
\Return{$DPLL(\phi \land l) \lor DPLL(\phi \land \lnot l)$}
