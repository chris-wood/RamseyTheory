\section{Background}
Edge Folkman numbers, first introduced by Folkman in 1970 \cite{Folkman}, are concerned
with the study of graphs in which a monochromatic coloring of a particular subgraph always exists. 
We write $G \to (a_1, ..., a_k; p)^e$ if for ever edge coloring of an undirected simple graph $G$ not 
containing $K_p$, there exists a monochromatic $K_{a_{i}}$ in color $i$ for some $i \in \{1, ..., k\}$. 
The edge Folkman number is defined as $F_e(a_1, ..., a_k) = \min\{|V(G)| : G \to (a_1, ..., a_k; p)^e\}$.
In 1970 Folkman proved that for all $k > \max(s,t)$, edge- and vertex- Folkman numbers $F_e(s,t;k$
and $F_v(s,t;k)$ exist. Prior to this, Erdos and Hajnal pose the problem of finding $F_e(3,3;4)$, which
can be informally stated as the following question \cite{Erdos01}: 

\noindent \emph{What is the order of the smallest $K_4$-free graph for which any $2$-coloring of 
its edges must contain at least one monochromatic triangle?}

This is equivalent to finding the smallest $K_4$-free graph that is not the union of two 
triangle-free graphs. Since the proposition of this problem, there has been a significant
amount of work towards aimed at narrowing the upper and lower bounds of $F_e(3,3;4)$. 
Table \ref{tab:history} enumerates the work on this problem and leads us to the 
current state of the field.

\section{Problems}
\subsection{Lower Bound}
The current lower bound for $F_e(3,3;4)$ stands at $19$ \cite{spr07}. The proof technique for this bound,
which relies on the fact that $H \to (3,3;4)^v \Rightarrow H + x \to (3,3;5)^e$, constructed all 
nonisomorphic graphs $G$ on $18$ vertices that contained independent sets $I$ of cardinality $4$. Then, for
each graph $G$, the authors used the fact that all induced subgraphs $H \in F_v(3,3;4)$, where $H$ is 
composed of the vertex set $V(G) \setminus I$. Using computations, the authors then constructed
all possible candidate graphs $G$ from these subgraphs $H$ by taking the union of the vertices in
$I$ with every vertex set $A \subset M$, where $M$ is the set of all subsets $A \subset V(H)$ such that
the graph induced by $A$ is a maximal triangle-free subgraph, and testing to see whether the resultant
graph $G$ arrows $(3,3)^e$. The fact that $\chi(G) \geq 6$ if $G \in \mathcal{F}_e(3,3;4)$ was used to further
restrict the candidate graphs $G$ that were checked. 

\subsection{Upper Bound}
Dudek and Rodel proved that $G \to (3,3)^e$ if and only if $MC(H_G) < 2t_{\Delta}(G)$ \cite{dudek08},
where $MC(H_G)$ is the size of the maximum cut of graph $H = (E(G), \{(e_1, e_2) | \{e_1, e_2, e_3\}$ form a triangle
in $G\}$. Since MAX-CUT is an NP-complete problem, computations using this fact rely on approximation
algorithms, such as the one proposed by Geomans and Williamson (TODO: CITE). In fact, Lange et al \cite{arlFolkman}
used this approximation approach, which formulates the MAX-CUT problem as a semidefinite program (SDP).
In their work, the authors examined graphs of the form 
$G(n, r) = (\mathbb{Z}_{n}, \{(x,y) | x \not= y, x - y \equiv \alpha^r \mod n, \alpha \in \mathbb{Z}_{n}\}$
Using these computations, the authors were able to show that $MC(H_{G_{786}}) \leq 857750$, where
$G_{786} = G(786, 3)$, and since $2t_{\Delta}(G_{786}) = 857762$, it is clear that $F_e(3,3;4) \leq 786$. 

It has been conjectured that $F_e(3,3;4) \leq 127$, which is motivated by the graph 
$G_{127} = (\mathbb{Z}_{127}, E = \{(x,y) | x - y = \alpha^3 \mod 127\})$ \cite{spr07}.
The intuition for this conjecture is that $G_{127}$ has a large number of triangles and many small dense subgraphs.
Proving or disproving this conjecture would be a significant result for the upper bound of
$F_e(3,3;4)$.

\section{Summary of Proposed Study}
The ultimate goal of this work is to attack both the upper and lower bounds of $F_e(3,3;4)$. 
Unfortunately, it will not be feasible to leverage the same technique used by Radziszowski 
et al to prove the current bound of $19$. The reason for this is that the estimated number of independent
sets of size $5$ in nonisomorphic graphs on $19$ vertices is expected to be more than $10^{19}$ \cite{spr1995}.
Clearly, the number of candidate graphs $G$ to check if $G \to (3,3)^e$ needs to be smaller, so we will
work towards devising constraints similar to the chromatic number $\chi(G) \geq 6$. We will also investigate
other facts about graph structure imposed by membership in the set $\mathcal{F}_e(3,3;4)$. 

Attacking the upper bound will be an entirely different form of computation. In particular, we will need to find a 
graph $G$ on $n$ vertices where $G \to (3,3)^e$. As previously discussed, we will be focusing on the graph 
$G_{127} = G(127,3)$ in an attempt to prove the conjecture that $G_{127} \to (3,3)^e$. 
To determine prove this we will decompose the problem arrowing problems on subgraphs $H$ that 
witness $H \not \to (3,3)^e$, and then carefully extend $H$ to encompass all of $G$. 

Unfortunately, due to the computationally intensive nature of this procedure, we will 
reduce $\{H | H \not \to (3,3)^e\}$ to 3-SAT and leverage
the power of SAT solvers such as Minisat \cite{minisat} and zChaff \cite{zchaff}. The reduction works by
mapping the edges in $E(H)$ to variables in $\phi_G \in$ 3-SAT, and for edge adding the following
clauses to $\phi_G$:
\begin{align*}
(x + y + z) \wedge (\bar{x} + \bar{y} + \bar{z})
\end{align*}
Clearly, $H \not \to (3,3)^e \Leftrightarrow \phi_G$ is satisfiable. Therefore, if $\phi_G$ is not satisfiable,
then $G \to (3,3)^e$, and so $F_e(3,3;4)$.

A major part of this work will be identifying candidate subgraphs $H$ for extension that 
can easily be solved using the aforementioned 3-SAT solvers. We will also take this opportunity
to compare the performance of popular k-SAT solvers published in the literature \cite{zchaff} \cite{minisat}.

\section{Project Goals and Deliverables}
The following project goals have been identified for this work
\begin{itemize}
	\item Research current methods and potential techniques for computing the upper and lower bounds of Folkman 
	numbers (in particular, $F_e(3,3;4)$).
	\item Implement software to aid in the computation of Folkman number bounds.
	\item Begin a survey paper outlining the history of Folkman number research \cite{sprSurvey}.
\end{itemize}

By achieving these goals I will generate the following deliverables:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Publication-ready paper and more in-depth progress report for the entire project
	\item Report that weighs the performance of various SAT solvers for solving this arrowing problem with $G_{127}$
	\item Report discussing the subgraph pruning techniques used for the lower bound
\end{itemize}
